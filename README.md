# DApp_trust
**Decentralsed Trust System built on top of the `Ethereum` platform.**

1. Setting up the project:
    - 1.1. `Truffle` framework for `Ethereum` project
    - 1.2. Dev/Test environment:
        - Local Ethereum network: `Ganache`
        - Ethereum test-net: `Rinkeby`

2. Algorithms
For better understanding and illustration, the algorithms are also written in Matlab which are more comprehensive and simplified.
    - 2.1. Experience Alorithm: `./experienceAlg.m`
    - 2.2. Reputation Algorithm: `./reputationAlg.m`

3. Smart Contracts development
- Smart Contracts are written in Solidity located in `./contracts/*`

4. Project deployment for real-world testing
    - 4.1. Deploy the Smart Contracts to `Rinkeby` test-net
